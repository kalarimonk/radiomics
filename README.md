# About the files

1. Biomarkers_Homework_Notebook.ipynb is the Jupyter notebook containing the code for the feature selection and the classification.

2.  The MATLAB files 
Homework_Dataset.mat -> .mat version of the dataset
Group_matching.m ->  Group Matching between PD vs HC for demographics and anthropometric features.
Comparison_groups.m -> Group comparisons with the selected radiomics features (from the notebook) 
Correlation_clinical_scores.m  -> Correlation between clinical scores and selected features for the PD subjects.


# Instructions to launch the Jupyter Notebook

1. Install Jupyter-notebook if not already installed using ‘pip install Jupyter-notebook’ or install Anaconda.
2. Open a terminal in the folder containing the notebook and run the command ‘jupyter-notebook’ in the terminal or the command-line.
3. For Windows, install Anaconda and that’s the best and easiest way to run the notebook.
4. You can launch the Jupyter notebook from the Anaconda application.
5. Please remember to update the path of the dataset in the Jupyter Notebook to match your work directory
6. Always use 'Restart and run all' to run the cells from the Kernel tab in the notebook
